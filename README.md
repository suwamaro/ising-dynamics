ising-dynamics
==========================

This is a sample code for the dynamics simulation of the Ising model. The time evolution is calculated using the Monte Carlo simulation and the Glauber dynamics (heat bath). The order parameters of several long-range orders are calculated together with the energy for each time step. The domain sizes are also calculated in ising4.4.
